{"loci":"rs11081078","finding":"The SNP rs11081078 was associated with IL-27 receptor signaling in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The study found that genetic loss of IL-27 receptor signaling suppressed HCC development, suggesting that this SNP may influence the activity of immune cells, particularly Natural Killer (NK) cells, in the tumor microenvironment. The elevation of IL-27R expression indicated poor prognosis in HCC patients, making rs11081078 a significant finding regarding its potential role as an immunological checkpoint in HCC development.","chrpos":"chr18:3954232","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.12.28.424635","title":"IL-27R signaling serves as immunological checkpoint for NK cells to promote hepatocellular carcinoma"}
{"loci":"rs12967143","finding":"The SNP rs12967143 was identified as an intragenic enhancer within the TCF4 gene.

{"loci":"rs35112771","finding":"The lead SNP rs35112771 was associated with the 18q21.33 locus and provided convincing evidence of eQTL colocalisation with SERPINB7 in non-sun-exposed skin tissue. SERPINB7 was implicated in several eczematous conditions and nonsense mutations were known to cause Nagashima-Type Palmoplantar Keratosis, indicating that common mutations influencing SERPINB7 expression could explain the missing heritability in atopic dermatitis.","chrpos":"chr18:63791680","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.04.20.050237","title":"MendelVar: gene prioritization at GWAS loci using phenotypic enrichment of Mendelian disease genes"}
