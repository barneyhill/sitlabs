This finding underscored the importance of genetic factors, particularly the MUC5B variant, in predicting ILA development among RA patients.","chrpos":"chr11:1219991","link":"https:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2022.12.17.22283610","title":"Prevalence and mortality associations of interstitial lung abnormalities in rheumatoid arthritis within a multicenter prospective cohort of smokers"}
