{"loci":"rs112806369","finding":"In the study, it was found that SNP rs112806369, which corresponds to the IGHV1-2 alleles A*02 and A*04, influenced the frequencies of vaccine-induced B cell responses. Specifically, allele A*02 was associated with stronger VRC01-class responses compared to A*04. The difference in response frequency was suggested to be primarily due to higher B cell frequencies associated with the A*02 genotype in the naive repertoire. The study documented that the mutation at this SNP, leading to an amino acid change (Arg66 to Trp66), was favored in VRC01-class maturation in A*04 homozygous individuals, which may have contributed to the observed BCR ratios favoring A*02 in heterozygous individuals.","chrpos":"chr14:105986679","link":"https:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.03.10.23287126","title":"Human immunoglobulin gene allelic variation impacts germline-targeting vaccine priming"}
