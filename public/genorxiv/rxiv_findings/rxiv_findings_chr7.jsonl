The risk allele was found to reduce DNAm levels from 0.46 to 0.19 compared to the reference allele 'C'. This reduction in DNAm was hypothesized to enhance enhancer activity and subsequently increase EGFR expression level, which has been implicated in amyloid-\u03b2 induced memory loss and neuroinflammation in the context of AD.","chrpos":"chr7:54881563","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2024.01.18.576319","title":"Deep learning predicts DNA methylation regulatory variants in specific brain cell types and enhances fine mapping for brain disorders"}

This aligns with previous data that show that its genetic influence on expression can be discerned within hiPSC lines cultured in village systems, indicating consistent line-dependent transcriptional effects.","chrpos":"chr7:150322545","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2021.08.19.457030","title":"Village in a dish: a model system for population-scale hiPSC studies"}
