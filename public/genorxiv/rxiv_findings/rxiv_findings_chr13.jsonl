In a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS), it exhibited a significant association with a p-value of 1.03 x 10^-6 and an effect size of 38.7%. This SNP also contributed to a combined effect size of 59.2% when analyzed alongside the T-13910 SNP, demonstrating its relevance to glucose levels in the bloodstream after lactose ingestion. However, the region containing the rs6563275 did not display any signals of recent selection in scans against the Yoruba population.","chrpos":"chr13:82218857","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/650986","title":"Population history and genetic adaptation of the Fulani nomads: Inferences from genome-wide data and the lactase persistence trait"}
{"loci":"rs11571833","finding":"The SNP rs11571833 was identified in a breast cancer susceptibility GWAS with a p-value of 2 x 10^-6. The finding related to breast cancer risk was considered significant based on prior knowledge of the BRCA2 gene, known for its role as a tumor suppressor involved in DNA repair. The evidence suggested that this SNP was likely a true finding, indicating a potential association with increased breast cancer risk.","chrpos":"chr13:32398489","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/737676","title":"Priors, population sizes, and power in genome-wide hypothesis tests"}

{"loci":"rs80359104","finding":"The missense variant rs80359104, which corresponds to the c.8524C>T (p.R2842C) mutation in the BRCA2 gene, was identified as a significant finding. This variant was correlated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), exhibiting a homozygous state in the studied patient from a consanguineous background. The variant was absent in unrelated fertile controls and had a very low minor allele frequency (MAF 1.10^-5), indicating its rarity. Moreover, it was predicted to be pathogenic by a majority (16 out of 17) of predictive softwares, suggesting a critical role in fertility and genome maintenance during meiotic processes.","chrpos":"chr13:32370992","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/751644","title":"A homozygous hypomorphic BRCA2 variant causes primary ovarian insufficiency without cancer or Fanconi anemia traits"}
