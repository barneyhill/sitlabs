The C allele of this SNP was found to induce a unique immune response to Yersinia pestis, thereby demonstrating its role in the immune response during that historical epidemic.","chrpos":"chr5:96908845","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.04.06.535944","title":"Reply to Barton et al: signatures of natural selection during the Black Death"}
