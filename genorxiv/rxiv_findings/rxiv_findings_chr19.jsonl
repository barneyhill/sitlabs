This variant was observed in 2,085 hospitalized COVID-19 cases compared to 534,965 controls, and it showed a high odds ratio (OR=93.9), indicating a strong association despite not reaching genome-wide significance. Notably, this finding was supported by two independent studies, and multiple additional rare variants in the same promoter region displayed directionally-consistent associations with the hospitalization phenotype. Furthermore, the variant was predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding, which could affect EEF2 gene expression, and its presence correlated with high EEF2 expression levels in one individual carrying the variant. However, subsequent analyses of 4,341 COVID-19 cases failed to find any carriers of this variant, raising uncertainty about the strength and replicability of the association.","chrpos":"chr19:3985461","link":"https:\/\/www.medrxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.10.28.20221804","title":"A catalog of associations between rare coding variants and COVID-19 outcomes"}
