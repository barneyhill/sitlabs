{"loci":"rs1160985","finding":"The SNP rs1160985 was identified as a peak SNP for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) with a discovery P-value of 2.61 x 10^-20. It also showed association with total cholesterol (TC) and demonstrated replication for these traits, suggesting its relevance in lipid metabolism in Samoans.","chrpos":"chr19:44900155","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/411546","title":"Genome-wide association studies in Samoans give insight into the genetic architecture of fasting serum lipid levels"}
{"loci":"rs7412","finding":"The rs7412 SNP was linked to the E4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is the strongest genetic predictor of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The analysis of young female carriers of the E4 allele demonstrated a notable decrease in energy expenditure when compared to non-carriers, indicating a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis in line with findings related to E4-associated metabolic rewiring.","chrpos":"chr19:44908822","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.10.19.345991","title":"APOE4 Lowers Energy Expenditure and Impairs Glucose Oxidation by Increasing Flux through Aerobic Glycolysis"}
{"loci":"rs429358","finding":"The rs429358 SNP is another allele-determining SNP of the APOE gene, similarly associated with the E4 allele. Participants with this SNP exhibited decreased oxygen consumption and increased plasma lactate levels as part of the metabolic changes observed, which align with a Warburg-like metabolic endophenotype suggestive of early Alzheimer's pathology.","chrpos":"chr19:44908684","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.10.19.345991","title":"APOE4 Lowers Energy Expenditure and Impairs Glucose Oxidation by Increasing Flux through Aerobic Glycolysis"}
