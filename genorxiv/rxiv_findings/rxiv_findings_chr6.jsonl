{"loci":"rs12203592","finding":"The SNP rs12203592 was associated with a C-to-T mutation that created a ZEB\/SNAI-like motif, negatively contributing to the MEL (melanocytic) topic score of the IRF4 enhancer. This SNP was linked to phenotypes such as freckles, brown hair, and high sensitivity of the skin to sun exposure. The presence of this repressor motif decreased the MEL prediction score, and mutating this motif led to an increase in the topic 4 prediction score. This indicated that the ZEB\/SNAI-like transcription factor binding motif functioned as a repressor for the MEL state.","chrpos":"chr6:396321","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2019.12.21.885715","title":"Cross-species analysis of melanoma enhancer logic using deep learning"}
