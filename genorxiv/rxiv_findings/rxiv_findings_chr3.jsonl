Men with GG homozygous genotype exhibited reduced empathy and prosocial behaviors, implicating its role in socio-emotional functioning.","chrpos":"chr3:8762685","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.08.24.554569","title":"Situating the oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms in the context of structural and connectome-level substrates and association with endogenous oxytocin"}
{"loci":"rs1042778","finding":"For SNP rs1042778, men demonstrated greater cSA in the right inferior temporal gyrus and structural connectivity differences compared to targeted allele carriers. This SNP was linked to reduced prosocial behaviors and was noted for showing negative correlations with functional connectivity metrics, presenting ties to socio-emotional processing.","chrpos":"chr3:8752859","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.08.24.554569","title":"Situating the oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms in the context of structural and connectome-level substrates and association with endogenous oxytocin"}
{"loci":"rs2254298","finding":"The rs2254298 SNP showed larger cSA in men, particularly within the left middle temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and superior parietal gyrus. This variant was associated with smaller bilateral amygdala volumes, and impacted socio-emotional behaviors such as autism spectrum disorder and depression among women.","chrpos":"chr3:8760542","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.08.24.554569","title":"Situating the oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms in the context of structural and connectome-level substrates and association with endogenous oxytocin"}
{"loci":"rs13071572","finding":"The SNP rs13071572 was associated with mechanisms of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a study regarding cisplatin-induced AKI. The findings indicated that variants linked to this SNP were correlated with worse outcomes in kidney resilience. In this context, the study explored several genetic mitigations, highlighting the role of QPRT and its regulation by the transcription factor HNF4alpha, in maintaining NAD+ levels in kidney cells.","chrpos":"chr3:18217730","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.05.23.541987","title":"HNF4\u03b1 mediated QPRT expression in the kidney facilitates resilience against acute kidney injury"}
{"loci":"rs53576","finding":"The rs53576 SNP was associated with the functionality of the OXT receptor (OXTR) in humans, specifically noting that the GG genotype led to a higher production of OXTRs compared to the AG or AA genotypes. This increased availability of OXTRs correlated with an enhanced ability to discriminate language under noisy conditions, highlighting the important role of OXT in sensory processing and behavioral response to social auditory information. Moreover, the text suggested that OXT may modulate maternal vocalizations and is important for understanding maternal care behaviors.","chrpos":"chr3:8762685","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.12.03.409557","title":"An acute dose of intranasal oxytocin rapidly increases maternal communication and maintains maternal care in primiparous postpartum California mice"}
