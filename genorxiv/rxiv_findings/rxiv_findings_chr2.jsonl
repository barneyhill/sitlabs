The study proposed that while the V220A mutation did not independently cause pathology, it might worsen the effects of the more severe T120M mutation.","chrpos":"chr2:20005875","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.05.19.103960","title":"Human iPSC-derived hypertrophic chondrocytes reveal a mutation-specific unfolded protein response in chondrodysplasias"}
