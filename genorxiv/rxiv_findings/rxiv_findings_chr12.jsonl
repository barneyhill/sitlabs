{"loci":"rs11060837","finding":"The SNP rs11060837 was associated with the expression regulation of the HOX cluster miRNAs, particularly impacting miR-196b, in the context of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The study indicated that the deletion of HOTTIP, which is linked to this SNP, led to a significant reduction in miRNAs, consequently promoting apoptosis through elevation of the FAS gene expression. This relationship provided insights into how genetic variations could influence the pathogenesis of AML.","chrpos":"chr12:130347129","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2021.07.15.452559","title":"A coordinated function of lncRNA HOTTIP and miRNA-196b underpinning leukemogenesis by targeting Fas signaling"}
{"loci":"rs10774625","finding":"The lead common variant rs10774625 was previously shown to tag a haplotype block encompassing the entire SH2B3 gene and was strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). It acted as a significant expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), thereby linking SH2B3 expression levels to SLE risk.","chrpos":"chr12:111472415","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.04.27.538529","title":"Rare SH2B3 coding variants identified in lupus patients impair B cell tolerance and predispose to autoimmunity"}
{"loci":"rs3184504","finding":"The missense variant rs3184504 was identified in proximity to the SH2B3 gene, exhibiting a high linkage with the lead variant rs10774625 (r2 = 0.92). This association further reinforced the connection between SH2B3 and the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus by suggesting that variants like rs3184504 may influence the protein's function in a way that predisposes individuals to B cell development abnormalities and autoimmune responses.","chrpos":"chr12:111446804","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.04.27.538529","title":"Rare SH2B3 coding variants identified in lupus patients impair B cell tolerance and predispose to autoimmunity"}
