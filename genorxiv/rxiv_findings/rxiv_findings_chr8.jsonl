{"loci":"rs28834970","finding":"The rs28834970 variant, located in an intronic enhancer of the PTK2B gene, was identified as a causal SNP associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). It was shown that the C allele of this SNP decreased PTK2B expression in hiPSC-derived macrophages and microglia. This decrease in expression correlated with altered chromatin accessibility and the introduction of a novel binding site for CEBPB transcription factors, leading to significant effects on the transcriptome. Specifically, there were reductions in the expression of various chemokines and impaired chemotaxis of microglial cells towards chemoattractants, which are relevant to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.","chrpos":"chr8:27337604","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.11.04.565613","title":"An Alzheimer\u2019s disease-associated common regulatory variant in PTK2B has causal effects on microglial function"}
