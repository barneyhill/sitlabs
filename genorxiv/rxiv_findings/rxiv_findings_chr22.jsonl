{"loci":"rs139298","finding":"The SNP rs139298, which causes the K121E mutation in APOBEC3H Haplotype I, was originally reported to be associated with lung cancer. It was further established that this mutation led to the destabilization of APOBEC3H, thus contributing to cancer evolution. Specifically, the K121E alteration disrupted the enzyme's structure and catalytic activity, resulting in significant genomic mutations in lung cancer cells. The findings suggested that the absence of APOBEC3H Haplotype I was associated with lung cancer, countering the typical understanding of mutagens in cancer advancement.","chrpos":"chr22:39101447","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2020.02.28.970509","title":"Induced mutagenesis by the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3H Haplotype I protects against lung cancer"}
