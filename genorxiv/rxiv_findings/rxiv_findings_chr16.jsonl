{"loci":"rs3752495","finding":"The rs3752495 SNP was identified as a causal insomnia risk variant located within an intron of the WDR90 gene, influencing the splicing and transcript expression of the neighboring gene PIG-Q. Notably, luciferase assays indicated that the risk allele of rs3752495 resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in luciferase expression, demonstrating its regulatory potential. The allele-specific effect significantly increased luciferase activity when comparing the risk allele to the non-risk allele, hence establishing rs3752495 as a key player in insomnia pathways.","chrpos":"chr16:660473","link":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/10.1101\/2023.08.17.553739","title":"Perturbation of the insomnia WDR90 GWAS locus pinpoints rs3752495 as a causal variant influencing distal expression of neighboring gene, PIG-Q"}
